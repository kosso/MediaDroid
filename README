A demo Titanium app to use Intents for recording audio or video using the native recording apps.

Audio quality is quite poor using the AMR codec at 8000KHz.  but the video recorder can use whichever settings the user
has decided to use in the recorder settings. 

This demo requires the use of a custom Titanium module, provided in the 'module' folder. THe source code for the module 
is available in my 'MediaQuery' repository [https://github.com/kosso/Mediaquery]
